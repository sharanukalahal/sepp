<h5>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, but one small population exists elsewhere.
Male lions can weigh 30 stoneThey start off spottyThe magnificent manes on male lions tell a story
Lion cubs are reared togetherLions can get their water from plantsLions are big eaters
They hunt during storms.</h5>
